# Giovanni Bianco

With a background in competitive mathematics and experience across three continents, I bring an analytical yet creative approach to problem-solving — grounded in statistics, computer science, and economics.

I graduated with full marks and honors (110/110 cum laude) from the BSc in Economics, Management, and Computer Science at Bocconi University, completing three years in two after a course change. During my exchange at the University of Technology Sydney, I strengthened my foundations in mathematics and artificial intelligence through graduate-level coursework.

As an AI/ML Engineer Intern at Accenture, I worked on designing and deploying AI agents to automate complex decision-making workflows, gaining hands-on experience at the intersection of theory and real-world impact.

I am now pursuing a dual MSc: Computer Science at Columbia University and Economics and Social Sciences at Bocconi University.

My interests lie at the crossroads of theoretical computer science, AI, and game theory — from advancing research to creating transformative technologies that shape the future of human–machine collaboration.

Give me a challenging problem, and I will approach it with precision, creativity, and persistence.
