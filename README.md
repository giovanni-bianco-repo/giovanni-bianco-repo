# Giovanni Bianco
With a background in competitive mathematics, experience across three continents, and a strong foundation spanning multiple disciplines (statistics, mathematics, computer science, microeconomics and management) I bring a unique, interdisciplinary approach to problem-solving. 

I am on track to graduate with honors from the BSc in Economics, Management, and Computer Science from Bocconi University, completing 3 years in 2 after a course change.

 I further expanded my mathematics and AI foundation through an exchange program at the University of Technology Sydney, where I took graduate level courses.

Starting in September, I will be pursuing an MSc in Computer Science at Columbia University, and, at the same time, an MSc in Economics and Social Sciences at Bocconi.

My aspirations range from pioneering research in theoretical computer science and AI, at the intersection with mathematics and game theory, to developing transformative products that drive real societal impact.

Give me a challenging problem, and I will approach it with determination, creativity, and precision.
