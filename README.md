# 👋 Giovanni Bianco

💡 With a background in competitive mathematics and experience across three continents, I bring an analytical yet creative mindset to tackling complex problems — grounded in statistics, computer science, and economics.

🎓 I graduated with full marks and honors (110/110 cum laude) from the BSc in Economics, Management, and Computer Science at Bocconi University, completing three years in two after a course change.

🌏 During my exchange at the University of Technology Sydney, I deepened my understanding of mathematics and artificial intelligence, taking graduate-level courses that shaped my research perspective.

🤖 As an AI/ML Engineer Intern at Accenture, I worked on building and deploying AI agents to automate complex workflows — blending machine learning, optimization, and systems design to create tangible business impact.

🎯 I’m now pursuing two MSc degrees simultaneously:
	•	💻 Computer Science at Columbia University
	•	📊 Economics and Social Sciences at Bocconi University

🧠 My passions lie at the crossroads of theoretical computer science, AI, and game theory — from advancing fundamental research to crafting transformative, human-centered technologies.

⚙️ I’m currently deepening my understanding of computer systems, exploring Linux kernel development and high-performance AI architectures, with the goal of pushing the boundaries of scalable, intelligent systems.

🚀 Give me a challenging problem, and I’ll approach it with precision, creativity, and persistence.
